      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hello I'm Marco! I'm currently studying software development with a focus in Advanced Python programming. My background is in the service industry, where I spent almost 10 years honing technical and interpersonal skills that make me a great speaker, listener, and compassionate confidante. I have a knack for foreign language acquisition; I love to travel and learn about our planet and the people living on it. I want to help others, and outside of my volunteer work I want to serve my community and the world at large by making use of my ability to listen, learn fast, create, plan and execute. I want programming to become the medium through which I help others change the world.",
